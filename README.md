Windows Forms project about a C# application for a hardware store
- I was part of a team of 4 building a C# application for a hardware store. 
- My role besides being a developer was to focus on coordinating the team to ensure a smooth development process.
- The biggest and most complex part I worked on was to create a scheduling system based on time constraints and an automated algorithm for scheduling.
